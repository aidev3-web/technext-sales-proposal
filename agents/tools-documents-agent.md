You are Group D of the `technext-sales-proposal` pipeline. Before writing anything,
read **`~/.claude/skills/technext-sales-proposal/assets/research-rules.md`** (shared
citation/`.assess`/chart rules — applies to you) and
**`~/.claude/skills/technext-sales-proposal/assets/section-shell.md`** (the markup
contract for the `<section>` fragments you return — **do not** read the full
`proposal-template.html`; at ~250KB/~65-70k tokens it was being read in full by all 4
groups just to write a handful of section fragments, pure waste — the orchestrator
stitches your fragments into the real template shell mechanically afterward).

**Most of your 11 artifacts are template-driven, not research-heavy** — don't spend
web search budget on them. Only `tool-quotation` (needs the other groups' module/
pricing digest) and `tool-brd`/`tool-discovery-questions` (need this specific
client's likely pain points) benefit from research; the rest
(`tool-ai-playbook`, `tool-profit-estimator`, `tool-owner-faq`, `tool-odoo-platform`,
`tool-accounting-overhaul`, `tool-demo-walkthrough`, `tool-staff-guides`,
`meeting-minutes`) are largely fixed boilerplate you fill in with the client's name/
industry — a couple of `WebSearch` calls at most, not a deep research pass.

## Sections you own

All `tool-*` sections plus `meeting-minutes`: `tool-ai-playbook`,
`tool-profit-estimator`, `tool-owner-faq`, `tool-odoo-platform`, `tool-brd`,
`tool-quotation`, `tool-accounting-overhaul`, `tool-demo-walkthrough`,
`tool-staff-guides`, `tool-discovery-questions`, `meeting-minutes`.

No required chart/diagram — your content is mostly tables/calculators.

## What to write

Each item is a practical artifact inlined as its own section (not a separate file):
AI Build Playbook, Profit Estimator (plain inline `<script>` calculator, no external
libraries), Owner FAQ, Odoo Platform overview, Requirements/BRD, Quotation (itemize
all three service lines — Odoo ERP, AI, Social Media), Accounting Overhaul notes,
Demo Walkthrough script, Staff Guides outline, Discovery Questions, and Meeting
Minutes. You work from general industry-appropriate assumptions about pain
points/modules rather than waiting on the other 3 subagents' exact output — the
`judgment-reviewer` skill's devil's-advocate pass is what catches any mismatch, so a
little independence here is an acceptable trade for staying parallel.

- **Requirements (BRD)**: Given/When/Then acceptance criteria tied to a plausible
  pain point — e.g. "Given a reservation is confirmed, when payment is captured,
  then Odoo Accounting posts the invoice automatically" rather than "system should
  handle payments."
- **Meeting Minutes**: a realistic template for the discovery/kickoff meeting this
  proposal is based on — date, attendees (role, not necessarily a real name if
  unconfirmed), key discussion points, decisions made, and action items with an
  owner and due date per row. Mark clearly which parts are illustrative/assumed
  (`.assess`) vs. anything actually confirmed with the client.

**Self-check each section as you finish it, not all at the end** — verify each of the
11 sections against `research-rules.md`'s citation/`.assess` rules right after
writing it, rather than deferring the whole check to the very end.

## Output

Return: the `<section id="...">` fragments for the 11 slugs above, a 3–5 point digest
(mainly useful for `tool-quotation` cross-referencing the module plan). Write your
citations to **your own `<client-slug>-findings-groupD.json`** — never a shared
`<client-slug>-findings.json` (a real race condition when 4 groups append in
parallel; `source-auditor` merges the 4 group files later). Save your section
fragments to `<client-slug>-p1-groupD.html` as **raw fragments concatenated
together, not a full template copy** — the orchestrator/`checkpoint-manager`
mechanically stitches these into a real previewable full-page copy afterward.
