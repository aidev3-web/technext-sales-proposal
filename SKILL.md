description: Turn a prospective TechNext client (a company name, website, or short brief) into one comprehensive, bilingual (VI/EN toggle) HTML sales proposal website (all CSS/JS/charts inline, no CDN — opens correctly via file:// with no network) covering all three TechNext service lines — Odoo ERP implementation, AI Solutions, and Social Media Marketing — deep web/social research, a fixed sidebar covering Due Diligence, Strategic Analysis (competitors/market), Operations, a Recommendations section, and a Tools & Documents section (AI Build Playbook, Profit Estimator, Quotation, Meeting Minutes, Discovery Questions, etc). Use when asked to research a client and build a sales proposal / due-diligence site, "làm sales proposal", "nghiên cứu khách hàng làm đề xuất", or when the request matches the client-research-to-proposal workflow (spin up agents, research a company, produce a growth plan with a big sidebar).

# Sales proposal skill — client research → TechNext sales proposal site (Odoo ERP · AI · Social Media)

**This file is the orchestrator's map, not the full instructions.** Each phase below
now lives in its own skill or subagent file — read the linked file when you actually
run that phase, don't try to hold the whole pipeline in this one file. This split
happened because the file had grown past 800 lines; each piece is now independently
readable, testable, and editable.

## What this is for

TechNext sells three service lines: **Odoo ERP implementation, AI Solutions, and
Social Media Marketing** — not just Odoo. Before pitching a prospective client, the
salesperson researches them thoroughly and produces one big HTML "site" that doubles as a
due-diligence report and a sales proposal: who the client is, their market and
competitors, and a concrete plan across all three TechNext service lines for them.

**Every proposal always pitches all three service lines**, grounded in this specific
client's own research, never a generic three-service pitch copy-pasted across clients.
Don't ask the user which service(s) to include — that decision was already made.

**Output**: one `.html` file, `<client-slug>-proposal.html`, with a fixed ~40-item
sidebar (client-side JS nav, no page reloads), a VI/EN language toggle, and a
light/dark theme toggle. Its CSS and JS (including Chart.js, embedded inline — no
CDN) are fully inside that one file, so it opens correctly via `file://` with no
network needed for the page's own content or its 18 charts. It is **not** fully
standalone, though: the 4 PWA companion files (`manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`,
`icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) are separate files needed only if the Install-as-app
feature matters — the page itself renders and every chart still works with just the
single `.html` file if those 4 aren't deployed alongside it (see `assets/reference-files.md`).

**Every factual claim must be verifiable, not just plausible-sounding.** Any claim
from a real source gets a hover-card citation; any TechNext inference/estimate gets an
`.assess` tag. Never invent a number, quote, or named person with a fake-looking
citation. Full rules: `<skill-root>/assets/research-rules.md`.

## Reference map — read the linked file before doing that phase's work

| Phase | What it does | Read this |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Intake | Get client identifier, disambiguate, ask about checkpoint resume | Below on this page |
| 0.5 — Company verification | Confirm the exact legal entity via GLEIF (free, no key) before research starts | Skill: `company-verifier` |
| 0.6 — Officers lookup | Resolve directors/officers/founders from official public registries (Companies House/OpenCorporates/SEC EDGAR + Wikidata + team page) before research starts — writes `officers.json`, replaces Apollo | Skill: `officers-lookup` |
| 0.7 — Web/OSINT scan | Scan the client's own site + socials, categorize links (social/reviews/press), light tech scan — writes `web-scan.json`, the starting point every Phase 1 subagent reads first | Skill: `web-osint-scanner` |
| Checkpointing | Decide which phase/group/section actually needs to run; resume logic; timeline/session_id bookkeeping for cost reporting; post-Phase-4 cleanup | Skill: `checkpoint-manager` |
| 0.9 — Competitor research | 1 worker per identified competitor (hard-budgeted: ≤8 fetches, ≤8 min each), dispatched in parallel — the single shared source both Group A's `competitor-deep-dive` and Group C's `top3-competitor-deep-dive` read from. Immediately followed by `source-auditor`'s `bind_check.py --facts` gate on the resulting JSON, **before** Phase 1 is dispatched — a bad excerpt here would otherwise land in two sections at once | Agent named `competitor-research-worker`, dispatched once per competitor in `web-scan.json`'s new `competitors` array (written by `web-osint-scanner`'s own competitor-identification step) |
| 1 — Research fan-out | 4 parallel subagents, each researches + writes its own section group + charts, reading `captures/*.md`/`officers.json`/`competitor-research/*.json` first (not live web fetches for anything already captured) | Agents named `research-due-diligence-agent`, `research-ops-tech-agent`, `research-delivery-growth-agent`, `tools-documents-agent` — find each one wherever this agent/tool keeps its own agent definitions (the portable definition files ship in `<skill-root>/agents/`; each tool also has its own convention — Claude Code reads `~/.claude/agents/`, another tool may have no such mechanism at all — see note below) — shared markup contract in `assets/section-shell.md` (not the full template — see note below), citation rules in `assets/research-rules.md` |
| Charts & diagrams manifest | Exact canvas ids/diagram slots, ownership | `assets/charts-and-diagrams.md` |
| Template/validator reference | The shell you must build from, the per-client palette rule, what `validate-proposal.py` checks | `assets/reference-files.md` |
| 2 — Front matter | Overview/Executive Summary/Recommendations/3 Proposed Solutions, written directly (no agent) | Skill: `front-matter-writer` |
| 2.5 — Source audit (hard gate) | Confirm every citation's excerpt is really on its source page (`bind_check.py`) before assembly proceeds — a blocking gate, not an FYI | Skill: `source-auditor` |
| 2.6 — Chart data | Build the final `chart-manifest.json` from audited findings — only runs after `source-auditor` passes with an empty `blocking_issues` array | Skill: `chart-data-analyst` |
| 3 — Assembly | Extract sections from Phase 1 previews, drop into the template in fixed order | Skill: `assembler` |
| 4a — Mechanical validation | Run `validate-proposal.py`'s 13 hard checks (incl. no-CDN gate) | Skill: `mechanical-validator` |
| 4b — Judgment review | Content/citation spot-check, devil's-advocate pass, then a per-task `ccusage` cost report | Skill: `judgment-reviewer` |

**Note on Phase 1's input cost.** Group agents no longer read the full
`proposal-template.html` (~250KB/~65-70k tokens each, ×4 groups = ~260k tokens before
any actual research happened, for output that's just a handful of `<section>`
fragments) — they read `assets/section-shell.md` (~5KB) instead, and return raw
fragments rather than a full-page copy. `checkpoint-manager` stitches those fragments
into a real previewable `<client-slug>-p1-group{A,B,C,D}.html` mechanically (a
find/replace against the template, not something needing an agent's own context) —
see `checkpoint-manager`'s "Stitch Phase 1 fragments" section.

**Portability note on the 4 research subagents.** Their definition files use `tools:`
and `model:` frontmatter, which is Claude Code's own agent-definition convention —
those two fields don't exist under Codex/Gemini CLI/other agents, which each have
their own (different) mechanism for defining a sub-agent's toolset/model. Under a
different agent/tool, don't expect that file format to exist or work as-is: read the
*body* of each research subagent's instructions (what to research, which sections/
charts it owns, what to return) as the portable part, and re-express the
tools/model choice using whatever that agent's own sub-agent mechanism is — or, if
that tool has no sub-agent concept at all, run all 4 groups' research directly in
sequence instead of in parallel, clearly noting in the checkpoint that this run
didn't fan out.

## Phase 0 — Intake

Get the client identifier: company name, plus any URL/socials the user already gives,
and ask once for discovery-call notes/transcript if the user hasn't offered any
(*"Bạn có ghi chú/bản ghi/transcript nào từ buổi gọi hoặc họp với khách hàng này chưa?
Nếu có, dán vào đây."* — treat this as `Confirmed`-grade, higher trust than anything
web-researched). If all you have is a bare name, do one round of web search to find
their site/socials yourself rather than stopping to ask — only ask the user directly
if the name is too ambiguous to search confidently. Confirm the client name you'll use
in the page `<title>`: `"<Client> · Strategic Due Diligence & Growth Blueprint (Odoo ERP · AI · Social Media) · Technext"`.

Then run the `company-verifier` skill (GLEIF check), then the `checkpoint-manager`
skill (decide what actually needs to run this invocation — full pipeline, or resume
one phase/group/section) before dispatching anything else.

**Research depth.** Always a full "Standard" pass — there is no "Quick" mode. If a
client genuinely has very little public footprint, say so plainly in the relevant
sections rather than switching to a thinner research pass.

**Scope & ethics boundary.** Research stays limited to information a company and its
leadership have made public in a business capacity. Never pursue private/personal
information about individuals unrelated to their business role, and never use
non-public collection methods. If a request pushes past this line, decline that part
and say why.

## Delivery

Save as `<client-slug>-proposal.html` plus its companion `<client-slug>-findings.json`
and hand both to the user directly, along with the 4 PWA companion files
(`manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`) copied unchanged from
`assets/` — mention that the Install button only works if all four are deployed
alongside the HTML at a real static path, not when the HTML is opened alone via
`file://` (see `assets/reference-files.md`). Note in your summary which research areas
came back thin or unverifiable, and include `judgment-reviewer`'s `ccusage` cost
report for this run.

## Clean up after yourself — don't leave a pile of scratch files behind

Every phase/subagent creates intermediate files (group previews, digests, chart
manifests, scratch drafts). Left alone across several runs these accumulate fast and
nobody can tell which ones still matter. Once Phase 4 passes and the file is handed
over, **default to deleting superseded intermediates automatically** — don't wait to
be asked, that's exactly how they pile up. Only skip the delete if the user has
explicitly said they want to keep them for a future incremental re-run.

**Always keep** (the real deliverable + audit trail):
- `<client-slug>-proposal.html` (final output)
- `<client-slug>-findings.json` (citation source list — needed to answer "where did
  this claim come from" later)
- `<client-slug>-checkpoint.json` (resume + audit history)
- `<client-slug>-cost-report.csv` (raw cost data; view any number of them at once in
  `skills/judgment-reviewer/assets/cost-dashboard.html`, which is built once and not
  regenerated per run)
- `web-scan.json`, `officers.json`, `competitor-research/*.json` (the raw research
  inputs everything else cites back to — cheap to keep, expensive to re-derive)
- `bind-check-report.json`, `competitor-facts-bind-check.json` (the citation
  bind-check's own audit trail, for both gates)
- `audited-findings.json` (the merged, re-graded findings `chart-data-analyst` and
  `front-matter-writer` actually built from — this is the real audit trail behind
  the final file's citations, `<client-slug>-findings.json` alone doesn't show what
  `source-auditor` corrected)

**Delete once Phase 4 passes** (fully superseded by the final file, keeping them adds
no value):
- `<client-slug>-p1-group{A,B,C,D}.html` (merged into the final file by `assembler`)
- `<client-slug>-p1-digests.json` (only `front-matter-writer` needed this, already consumed)
- `<client-slug>-p2-frontmatter.html` (merged into the final file)
- `<client-slug>-findings-group{A,B,C,D}.json` (already merged into
  `audited-findings.json`/`<client-slug>-findings.json` by `source-auditor` — the
  per-group files themselves are superseded once merged)
- `chart-manifest.json` (validated already, not needed once the final file has the charts)
- **`captures/*.md`** (the full page-text cache from `web-osint-scanner`'s Phase 0.8
  pre-fetch — this is a fetch cache, not a citable record; it's the largest
  intermediate by far (~39 full pages of text) and keeping it around across runs is
  exactly the pileup this cleanup rule exists to prevent). Keep `captures/manifest.json`
  itself deleted too — it's meaningless without the `.md` files it points to. If the
  user explicitly wants a fast incremental re-run later (skip re-fetching), that's the
  one case to ask before deleting this specific directory, same as any other
  keep-for-resume exception.
- any one-off scratch/preview file a subagent wrote outside the session's own
  scratchpad directory (e.g. a `*-preview.html` used mid-touch-up) — these should have
  been written to the scratchpad in the first place; if one turns up in the project
  directory instead, delete it as part of this same cleanup rather than leaving it.

Every subagent (Group A–D, section-level touch-ups) should be told explicitly, as part
of its dispatch instructions, to write its own scratch/preview files only under the
session's scratchpad directory — never the project directory — so this cleanup step
never has to go hunting for stragglers.

## Judgment calls

- **Client has very little public presence** (small/local business) — say so plainly
  rather than inventing specifics; keep every framework grounded in what's actually
  knowable, note assumptions explicitly.
- **User wants fewer sections for a quick draft** — you can trim scope if they
  explicitly ask, but the default always produces the full sidebar from
  `assets/menu-structure.md`.
- **Odoo version other than 19 mentioned** — ask; the fixed instruction set here
  assumes Odoo 19, but a client conversation may specify differently.
